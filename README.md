TaskHub is a responsive task marketplace built with Next.js and React.js, designed during my internship at Complus Tech Limited. Users can post micro-tasks (e.g., follow an Instagram account, comment on a YouTube video) and get paid by others willing to complete them, fostering a simple gig economy platform.

## ✨ Features
- **Task Posting**: Users can create tasks with details like type (e.g., social media actions) and payment offers.
- **Task Completion**: Workers browse and complete tasks, earning rewards for verified actions.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface using Next.js for seamless access across devices.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular React components for scalable task management and user interaction.
- **Deployment-Ready**: Hosted on Vercel for fast, global availability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Next.js
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Other**: JavaScript, CSS (optimized with Next.js styling)
